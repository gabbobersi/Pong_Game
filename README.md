# Pong game
This project represents an attempt to make the classic "Pong" game, but with **Turtle** standard module, instead of wellknown Pygame library.

Every match is "endless" (no points limit) and simply starts with the execution of the script.

There are 2 players active at the same time.

## Controls
**PLAYER A**: w (up), s (down).

**PLAYER B**: Arrow Up, Arrow Down.
